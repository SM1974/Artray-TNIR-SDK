# Artray-TNIR-SDK
**Development files based on .NET2 framework (x64 Windows) for Artray camera GUIs**

This code is a development branch of Artray sample source code Ver.1.3.1.3c available at the bottom of this page:
http://www.artray.us/download_sdk.html

The executable file Sample_CS_2010.exe in the 'bin' folder is designed to be operated with Artray USB3.0 InGaAs SWIR camera Model ARTCAM-990SWIR-TEC connected.

## Usage

Make sure that ArtCamSdk_990SWIR_TEC.dll is located in the same folder as Sample_CS_2010.exe.

Double click on Sample_CS_2010.exe. When the application window opens, click on the Action(A) menu and then click on 'Image Sequence'. This will copy a number of monochrome images in TIF format to the 'Pictures' folder on a Windows p.c.

Clicking on 'Image Sequence' again will not overwrite the image files saved the first time.
