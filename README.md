# Artray-TNIR-SDK
**Development files based on .NET framework 2.0 (x64 hardware platform) for Artray camera GUIs**

This code is a development branch of Artray sample source code Ver.1.3.1.3c available at the bottom of this page:
http://www.artray.us/download_sdk.html

The executable file Sample_CS_2010.exe in the 'bin' folder is designed to be operated with Artray USB3.0 InGaAs SWIR camera Model ARTCAM-990SWIR-TEC connected.

The source files are still a work in progress. The objective of the completed code is described in 
'20211015 General description of program requirements for capture of images using Artray camera.docx'

Install .NET Framework 3.5 to allow applications based on .NET Framework 2.0 to run in Windows 10.

## Usage

Make sure that ArtCamSdk_990SWIR_TEC.dll is located in the same folder as Sample_CS_2010.exe.

Double click on Sample_CS_2010.exe. When the application window opens, click on the Action(A) menu and then click on 'Image Sequence'. This will copy a number of monochrome images in TIF format to the 'Pictures' folder on a Windows p.c.

Clicking on 'Image Sequence' again will not overwrite the image files saved the first time.
